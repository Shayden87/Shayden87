# Artifact I
## Enhancement: Software Design/Engineering

This artifact is an implementation of a constructor and list/array through the Python language. It creates appointment objects through the Appointment class then allows them to be added to list/array through the AppointmentService class. The AppointmentService class also allows for the update and removal of objects from the list/array. It was originally created in Java back in 2020 and translated to Python in January 2022.

I included this artifact in my ePortfolio as it highlights my skills in the software design/engineering process. As the artifact also includes a Python unit test protocol it provides demonstration of skills that span the entire software development lifecycle from development of code to testing of that code. It showcases my skills in the use of data structures and creation of modular code that is clean, maintainable, and easy to understand. The artifact itself was improved through removing of redundant code and unnecessary methods, clean up of structural irregularity, addition of clear comments within code, and the translation from Java to Python. These refinements helped me meet my course objectives set in Module One and encapsulates the program outcome of demonstrating my skills within software engineering/design.

Through my refinement of this artifact, I learned quite a bit about my own work. I realized that my previous work in creation of the original artifact may have been in haste. While being able to code quickly can be an asset it should never come at the cost of quality of the work. There must be a balance struck between the two, especially in context of the professional realm and working for a client. Being able to go back I was able to find code that was redundant or unnecessary. Leaving this code would be a detriment to the artifact and present potential issues down the line if code were to be reused or modified. The challenges I faced during my enhancements lied within the translation of code from Java to Python. While I find Python more straightforward there are some capabilities within Java that make creation of data structures more detailed. Finding equivalent code capabilities within Python was challenging, but in the end, I felt the code was easier to read.
