# Spencer Hayden's ePortfolio

## Introduction

Greetings, my name is Spencer and welcome to my ePortfolio. <br>
I would like to start off with thanking you so much for taking the time to review my portfolio of work.
This ePortfolio showcases some of my work during my time within the Southern New Hampshire University Computer Science Program.
Its' purpose is to highlight the skills and strengths I have developed during the pursuit of my computer science degree. 

## Self Reflection

During my time in SNHU's computer science program I have learned a lot, developed new strengths, and bolstered existing strengths.
The coursework that I have been exposed to through the program has been diverse and comprehensive, and has opened me up to new experiences,
challenges, and success along the way. Through my work, and creation of this ePortfolio, I have furthered my ability to design, develop, and showcase
professional written/visual communications. I have a background in management, so I have always felt comfortable taking the lead and sharing my knowledge
and skills with others. However, the work I have developed and presented in my coursework has made me hone these abilities which would allow me to comfortably
communicate to a companies shareholders for instance. This strength brings the benefit of bridging the gap between the technical and financial sectors, allowing
me to play multiple roles as needed. <br> 

Working with both my instructors and peers during my time with SNHU has further developed strengths in team building and collaboration. By bouncing off design/development
ideas within our discussions or simply learning from the feedback given by instructors, I have come to appreciate and understand more the benefits and strengths of working
in such an environment. I also know that such environments have to be nutured/fostered as the don't always exist, and I believe I have developed the skills necessary to
champion this in the workplace. 

My coursework has covered many concepts within computer science to include Emerging System Archeticture & Technology, Computer Graphics, Secure Coding, Client/Server 
Development, Software Reverse Engineering, Website Design, Mobile Architecture/Programing, Data Structures & Algorithms, etc. All of these help develop their own 
focused strengths in students, but also overall skills and strengths within computer science covered in the Artifact Summary. 

## Artifact Summary

My chosen artifacts showcase the overall skills and strengths of data structures & algorithms, software design/engineering, databases and security. [Artifact I](ArtifactOne.md) 
demonstrates my skills and strengths in software design/engineering through the pairing of a constructor and array principles in the Python language. This artifact pairs its' 
functionality with testing which is an integral part of the design/engineering process and additionally showcases my understanding of these concepts. [Artifact II](ArtifactTwo.md) focuses on skills and strengths pertaining to data structures & algorithms by presenting vector data structures and the algoritms utilized to sort said vectors.
[Artifact III](ArtifactThree.md) demonstrates my work with databases. It presents my skills through implementation of MongoDB with CRUD operations paired with a web-based user 
interface through Jupyter Notebook. 

All of the artifacts come together to present a well rounded presentation of my continously developing strengths. Each of them showcase skills in code security as well through use of coding best practices where applicable. This is highlighted through password management, access control, input validation, and error handling. Skills in coding best practices were also employed with regards to structure, style, and code comments.
